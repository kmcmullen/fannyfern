                <p>We like <choice><sic>sometines</sic><corr>sometimes</corr></choice>, on our evening journey homeward in public conveyances, to pick out <hi rend="italic">the happy family men</hi>; and they are by no means so rare as sour, selfish people would have us believe. It gives us a thrill of delight to see in their hands a picture-book, or toy, or bouquet; for well we know the happiness these (so called) "trifles" bring to the expecting fireside circle. And well may a man treasure his fireside comforts; well may he remember those who make toil light to him, and guard him with loving hearts and pure arms, from the blighting, contaminating influences, which surround the solitary, yearning, unloved man in a great city. Well may he throw himself down upon the sofa and draw a long breath of relief, as the iron hand of barter and trade is lifted from his heart, and the doors are thrown wide open for love to enter. Well may he&#8212;like a miser&#8212;hoard these happy moments, ere death's shadow fall on his threshold, and he wander through desolate rooms&#8212;familiar, yet oh, so fearfully strange! followed by little pattering feet, that wander up and down through the long day in nursery and parlor, seeking her whose loss shall be greater and greater each day to the motherless. Oh, ye who have happy homes; who miss no dear head when the good-night blessing is given and taken; into whose face clear, <hi rend="italic">innocent</hi> eyes look lovingly, talk not of toil or labor with such blessings as these.</p>

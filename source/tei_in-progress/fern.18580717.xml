                <epigraph>
                    <p>Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1855, by ROBERT BONNER, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>

                    <p>After all, having tried it I affirm that nothing reconciles a woman quicker to her feminity, than an experiment in male apparel, although I still maintain that she should not be forbidden by law to adopt it when necessity requires; at least, not till the practice is amended by which a female clerk, who performs her duty equally well with a male clerk, recives less salary, simply because she is a woman.</p>
                    <p>To have to jump on to the cars when in motion, and scramble yourself on to the platform as best you may without a helping hand; to be nudged roughly in the ribs by the conductor with "your fare, sir?" to have your pretty little toes trod on, and no healing "beg your pardon," applied to the smart; to have all the nice-looking men who used to make you such cruching bows, and give you such insinuating smiles, pass you without the slightest interest in your coat-tails, and perhaps push you against the wall, or into the gutter, with a word tabooed by the clergy. In fine, to disperse with all those delicious little politenesses, (for men are great bears to each other,) to which one has been accustomed, and yet feel no inclination to take advantage of one's corduroys and secure an equivalent by making interest with the "fair sex," stale to you as a thrice told tale. Isnt' <hi rend="italic">that</hi> a situation?</p>
                    <p>To be subject to the promptings of that unstifleable feminine desire for adornment, which is right and lovely within proper limits, and yet have no field for your operations. To have to conceal your silken hair, and yet be forbidden a becoming moustache, or whiskers, or beard&#8212;(all hail beards, I say!) To choke up your nice throat with a disguising cravat; to hide your bust (I trust no Miss Nancy is blushing) under a baggy vest. To have nobody ask you to ice cream, and yet be forbidden by your horrible disgust of tobacco, to smoke. To have a gentleman ask you "the time, sir?" when you are new to the geography of your watch-pocket. To accede to an invitation to test your "heft," by sitting down in one of those street-wighing chairs, and have one of the male bystanders, taking hold of your foot, remark, "Halloo, sir, you must not rest these upon the ground while you are being weighed;" and go grinning away in your coat-sleeve at your truly feminine faux pas.</p>
                    <p>And yet&#8212;and yet&#8212;to be able to step over the ferry-boat chain when you are in a distracted hurry, like any other fellow, without waiting for that tedious unhooking process, and quietly to enjoy your triumph over scores of impatient-waiting crushed petticoats behind you; to taste that nice lager beer "on draught;" to pick up contraband bits of science in Medical Museums, forbidden to crinoline, and hold conversation with intelligent men, who supposing you to be a man, consequently talk sense to you. That is worth while.</p>
                    <p>Take it all in all, though, I thank the gods I am a woman. I had rather be loved than make love; though I could beat the makers of it, cut and out, if I did not think it my duty to refrain out of regard to their feelings, and the final disappointment of the deluded <gap reason="paper folder over" extent="four to five words"/> want to do such a wuantity of "improper" things, that there is not the slightest real harm in doing. I want to see and know a thousand things which are forbidden to flounces&#8212;custom only can tell why&#8212;I can't. I want the free use of my ankles, for this summer at least, to take a journey; I want to climb and wade, and tramp about, without carrying about with me a long procession of trunks and boxes, which are the inevitable penalty of feminity as at present appareled. I hate a Bloomer, such as we have seen&#8212;words are weak to say how much; I hate myself as much in a man's dress; and yet I want to run my fingers through my cropped hair some fine morning without the bore of dressing it; put on some sort of a loose blouse affair&#8212;it must be pretty, though&#8212;and a pair of Turkish trousers&#8212;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> Bloomers&#8212;and a cap, or hat&#8212;and start; "nary" a trunk&#8212;"nary" a bandbox. Woulnd't that be fine? But propriety scowls and says, "aint you ashamed of yourself, Fanner Fern?" <hi rend="italic">Yes, I am,</hi> Miss Nancy. I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> ashamed of myself, that I haven't the courage to carry out what would be so eminently convenient, and right, and proper under the circumstances. I am ashamed of myself that I sit like a fool on the piazza of some hotel every season, gazing at some distant mountain, which every pulse and muscle of my body, and every faculty of my soul, are urging me to climb, that I may "see the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them." I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> ashamed of myself that you, Miss Nancy, with your uplifted forefinger and your pursed-up mouth, should keep me out of a dress in which only I can hope to do such things. Can't I make a compromise with you, Miss Nancy? for I'm getting restless, as these lovely summer days pass on. I'd write such long accounts of beautiful things, Miss Nancy&#8212;things which God made for female as well as male eyes to see; and I should come home so strong and healthy, Miss Nancy&#8212;a freckle or two, perhaps&#8212;but who cares? O-h&#8212;n-o-w, Miss Nancy, d-o.&#8212;Pshaw! you cross old termagant. May Lucifer fly away wid ye.</p>

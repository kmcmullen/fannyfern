                <epigraph>
                    <p>Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1855, by ROBERT BONNER, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>

                <p>There are people who get up in the morning for the express purpose of making somebody uncom-fortable before the day is out. They generally pitch upon some sunny-faced, happy, singing hu-man lan<gap>reason=smudge on paper"extent=remainder of word</gap>, caroling high above the ditches and marshes of life, soaring in the blue ether of his happiness nearer Go and the angels than he himself knows anything about, and taking prac-ticed aim at some vulnerable point, bring him plump down, with maimed wing, to flutter in the dust. Now what is good enough for such a miscreant? The more you flutter the better he likes it; every writhe of your agonized spirit is delicious music to this vulture; there is one other person in the world as uncomfortable as himself. What right had <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to be happy when <hi rend="italic">his</hi>liver was out of order? It was clearly a piece of impertinent presumption, and so there you lie moan-ing and turning, the sunshine all gone, the chill mist of despondence gathering thick about you, and your persecutor standing by, turning you over now and then with his foot, to see if there is life enough left for a freah attack.</p>
                <p>You have seen just such I dare say; smooth-faced, plausible wretches, bowing and smirking you into the hottest purgatory. Now an honest enemy I knoq how to meet; but your malicious, mealy-mouthed, Watts-Psalms-and Hymns wretch, who takes your hand with his velvety palm, only to tell you that your hand with his velvety palm, only to tell you that your pulse is wrong, and that your father died at your age&#8212;I wonder if there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> salva-tion for such?</p>

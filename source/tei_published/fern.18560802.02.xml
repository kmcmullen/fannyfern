                <p>My friend Parton, in his recent book, called "Humorous Poetry of the English Language," says, that he could find no Humorous Poetry by Women, worthy a place in his collection; and his mind seems to be quite exercised in the Preface, upon this question: Can women write Humorous Poetry, or&#8212;can they not?</p>
                
                <p>I charge him no fee for my opinion, which is as follows:</p>
                
                <p>1st. That women have not written humorous verses for the reason, that Poetry, with them, is the outlet, only, for the holiest, strongest, and deepest feelings of their nature; they approach it, as the priests of old approached the sacred ark, with bowed heads and clean hands.</p>
                
                <p>2ndly. That in making this remark, I endorse the utility of Humorous Poetry in general, and this exhaustless fountain of fun, collected by my friend Parton, in particular; on the principle, that whatever shortens our faces, lengthens our days.</p>
                
                <p>3rdly&#8212;lastly, concludingly, and conclusively, I would venture to add, that it may be lucky for the male sex, that our sex never felt inclined to try their hand at Humorous Poetry.</p>

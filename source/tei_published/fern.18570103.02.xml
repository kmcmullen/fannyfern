                <p>That the most contemptible biped in pantaloons imagines that the most attractive and ladylike woman out on a sunshiny day, is but too happy to be ogled and followed.</p>
                
                <p>That women who are hump-backed, squint-eyed, or lame in one leg, should always select the most stunning colors and costumes.</p>
                
                <p>That women should show their shallowness in public by wearing conversationally threadbare the eternal "him," and the "lovely laces."</p>
                
                <p>That women should accept presents valuable, or the contrary, from gentlemen who are not relatives.</p>
                
                <p>That men should submit their chins and heads to the <hi rend="italic">promiscuous</hi> utensils of a barber.</p>
                
                <p>That men can use profane language, and deprecate female virtue, in the presence of ladies, and still expect to maintain their claims to the title of <hi rend="italic">gentlemen</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>That they can consider it a proof of a superior understanding, to sneer at the Sabbeth and those <gap reason="page folded over" extent="two words"/> and observe it.</p>
                
                <p><gap reason="page folded over" extent="eight to ten words"/> make matimonial overtures to little <gap reason="page folded over" extent="one word"/> of women.</p>
                
                <p>That a lecturer should so often find the lost thread of his discourse, in the tumbler of water at his elbow.</p>
                
                <p>That the tall, nicely got-up beau who occasionally shows himself in Broadway, should present the anomaly of a jet-black moustache with grey locks.</p>
                
                <p>That women should unrobe to "try on a dress before a dozen dress-makers' apprentices, and any stray lady visitor who calls on the same errand; not to mention the occasional ingress of the dress-maker's brother in search of&#8212;&#8212;his sister.</p>
                
                <p>Lastly&#8212;That two women should by any possibility be willing to sleep together.</p>

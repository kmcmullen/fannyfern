                <head type="main">A TILT AT THE NEW SPRING BONNETS.</head>
                
                <p>Editors are in league with the milliners&#8212;there is no doubt about that; a good&#8212;long&#8212;continuous&#8212;advertisement from them is a regular tongue-tyer to the editorial corps, who praise their most ridiculous inventions and importations, in the shape of bonnets; of which the new Spring hats are the most absurdly-absurd-absurdities.</p>
                
                <p>In this state of things, and in view of the horrors the milliners are about to visit on us ladies, (I need not say <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, for may I go barehead&#8212;I should say unbonnetted&#8212;before I mount one of them.) I hail with applause the following judicious and <hi rend="italic">independent</hi> editorial comments upon this subject from the Sunday Times&#8212;which I trust were written on a week day. They are those of a man whose opinion has not been bought up by milliners' advertisements, and whose sentiments are mine to the letter. But to the extract:</p>
                
                
                <q>Sir Pedestrian, did <hi rend="italic">you</hi> happen to notice the perplexed ladies out in the avenues so jostlingly last Thursday? Then, by these tokens did you recognize milliner's opening day.</q>
                
                <q>We have seen the hats. We abominate them. We pray for the extinction of the <hi rend="italic">shapes</hi>. How long shall the Empress Eugenie rule American ladies? We saw yesterday the wife of a prominent Hindoo with one of these abomination hats on (we beg pardon, <hi rend="italic">off,</hi>) her head. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> cries "Americans must rule America;" and yet allows the Empress to rule his wife, who rules him! Mrs. Napoleon is a Spanish lady. Spanish ladies abominate hats. Mrs. N., when she became a French wife, made a compromise, and wore something like a cap at the back of her head, and exposed the whole front and top: forthwith all England and America imitate her. Mrs. N. is in a looked-for situation, and she wears hoops: forthwith the ladies, young and old, of America and England imitate the hoops, producing a philosophical anomaly, in most cases, of an effect without a cause!</q>
                
                <q><hi rend="italic">When will the dear delightful "kiss-me-quicks" come back?&#8212;those saucy little bonnets, which gave the head shape&#8212;allowed us to see the neck, instead of its being hid by a curtain&#8212;gave a spirit to the spread of the shoulders, instead of hunching them&#8212;which covered the top of the head from rain and sun, and gave the face an expression of beauty&#8212;living Grecian beauty instead of making it appear as if the owner were being guillotined.</hi></q>
                
                <q><hi rend="italic">Well! we live in hope. When Eugenie gets her baby, and if it should turn out a girl, maybe she will feel like hiding her head. Then our ladies will do the same. As the fashions now go, bonnets are still off&#8212;so let the gentlemen in all gallantry try "Hats off!"</hi></q>
                
                
                <p>The only marvel to me is, how a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> could write so sensibly, and so knowingly, on so top-knot-ty a subject!</p>

                <p>I have just been reading a very severe criticism, from a London paper, on Miss Warner's last book "The Hills of the Shatemuc." That the London Athen&#230;um, the London Leader, and other kindred papers, should dislike Miss Warner's books, or those of any other American lady-author, whose sympathies are on the side of <hi rend="italic">evangelical religion</hi>, is not astonishing when one knows the anti-evangelical views of their editors. The fairness of condemning the book under consideration, and other American lady-books, <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi>, for that reason alone is sufficiently transparent. Miss Warner needs, as an author, no praise of mine; but what I would like to ask, is this: <hi rend="italic">Why</hi>&#8212;the New York paper, in which this severe and most unfair criticism of Miss Warner's book, from a London paper, was copied, is always so lynx-eyed to see, and so ready to pounce upon and pass round, any unfavorable trans-atlantic criticism of an American <hi rend="italic">lady</hi>-book, and so <hi rend="italic">very deaf, dumb and blind</hi>, when one comes from the same source, about Mr.&#8212;&#8212;'s Poems, Mr.&#8212;&#8212;'s Travels, Mr.&#8212;&#8212;'s novels, or indeed any American <hi rend="italic">male</hi> author's book <choice><sic>whatsover</sic><corr>whatsoever</corr></choice>?</p>
                
                <p>That lady-writers should have found favor with the public&#8212;no matter how great and pressing their pecuniary need, seems to have stirred up the bile of more than one pair of corduroys; and yet, despite the sneers of their owners at "female literature," plenty of instances can be cited, in which men (of late) who have been unable to attract attention literarily, <hi rend="italic">in propri&#230; person&#230;</hi>, have crept under a petticoat to try it in female guise; and what is worse, in this <hi rend="italic">incognita</hi> have made our sex answerable, for <hi rend="italic">double-entendres</hi>, and vulgarisms of sentiment and expression, from which any true woman would shrink.</p>
                
                <p>Be consistent gentlemen; or if you can't be consistent, be as consistent as you can!</p>
